# ModTemplate StarMade-Gradle Edition
StarMade mod starting template. Contains starting code as well as some useful library classes to help you get started.
Clone this repo and modify the gradle settings to use.  
  
Also happens to have a much less outdated gradle configuration.

Requires java 8 to run, but compiles to java 7 compatible bytecode.
